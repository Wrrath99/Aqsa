        <p class="profilep">An artist and graphic designer as well as a sculptor, I started my journey when I was sixyears old. I studied my interest in passion and became able to showcase my work. I've won various
            competitions and it have given me a lot of courage to move forward. Traditional art is what I'm best at but
            stopping there feels like waste so I decided to practice digital arts while running a very small business
            which went unexpectedly well for a time being which encouraged me to work more on my skills as an artist and
            do as much as I can as a human and contribute in history of arts and I hope to achieve it someday.</p>
